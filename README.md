## ⚠️ Regarding CPP Module 09

I would like to share that I undertook a personal challenge to complete the CPP Module 09 in just a few hours after it was published. In my pursuit of speed, I leveraged every point that wasn't clear in the subject at the beginning to finish the module as quickly as possible.

However, this approach resulted in extremely messy code. I prioritized speed over cleanliness, which is not a practice I would recommend for regular development work. Moreover, the final code does not align with the subject anymore.

Therefore, I strongly advise anyone who comes across this module to disregard the solutions for this last module, including the test cases.
